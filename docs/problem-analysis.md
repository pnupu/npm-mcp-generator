# Problem Analysis: Specific Use Cases

## Use Case 1: The Stripe API Developer

### Scenario

Sarah is building a payment integration and needs to use Stripe's API. She's working in Kiro and wants the AI to help her write correct Stripe integration code.

### Current Pain Points

- Kiro doesn't know about Stripe's specific API patterns, error handling, or best practices
- She has to constantly switch between her IDE and Stripe's documentation
- Generic code suggestions don't follow Stripe's conventions
- She makes mistakes with webhook signatures, idempotency keys, etc.

### What She Needs

- Kiro to understand Stripe's API structure and generate proper Stripe code
- Context about Stripe's error handling patterns
- Knowledge of Stripe's webhooks, testing patterns, and best practices

### Current Workaround

- Copy-paste from Stripe docs
- Manually explain Stripe patterns to Kiro in chat
- Trial and error with API calls

## Use Case 2: The Internal API Team

### Scenario

A company has extensive internal APIs documented in OpenAPI specs. New developers joining the team struggle to understand and use these APIs correctly.

### Current Pain Points

- Internal APIs aren't publicly documented, so no existing MCP servers exist
- New developers write incorrect API calls
- Code reviews catch the same API usage mistakes repeatedly
- Knowledge is trapped in senior developers' heads

### What They Need

- Kiro to understand their internal API patterns
- Automatic code generation that follows their conventions
- Context about internal business logic and edge cases

### Current Workaround

- Extensive onboarding documentation
- Code review process catches mistakes
- Senior developers provide guidance

## Use Case 3: The Open Source Contributor

### Scenario

Alex wants to contribute to a large open source project (like React, Django, etc.) but the codebase is massive and the contribution guidelines are complex.

### Current Pain Points

- Doesn't know the project's coding conventions
- Unsure about testing patterns and requirements
- Makes PRs that don't follow project standards
- Spends hours reading through contribution docs

### What They Need

- Kiro to understand the project's specific patterns and conventions
- Code suggestions that match the project's style
- Knowledge of testing requirements and PR guidelines

## The Core Problem Statement

**Developers need AI code assistance that understands the specific APIs, libraries, and codebases they're working with, but creating this context is currently manual and time-consuming.**

## The Specific Solution

**An MCP server that can ingest documentation (API specs, README files, contribution guides) and provide Kiro with deep context about specific tools, APIs, or codebases.**

## Success Criteria for Hackathon

### Minimum Viable Product

Pick ONE use case and solve it well:

- **Target**: Stripe API integration (Use Case 1)
- **Input**: Stripe's OpenAPI spec + documentation
- **Output**: MCP server that helps Kiro generate proper Stripe code
- **Demo**: Show Kiro generating a complete Stripe payment flow with proper error handling

### Why Stripe?

1. Well-documented API with OpenAPI spec
2. Common use case developers face
3. Clear success metrics (correct API usage)
4. Existing documentation to test against

## Validation Questions

1. Can we generate an MCP server from Stripe's docs that actually improves code suggestions?
2. Does the generated code follow Stripe's best practices?
3. Is this faster than manually creating an MCP server for Stripe?

## Next Steps

1. Get Stripe's OpenAPI spec and documentation
2. Define exactly what "good Stripe code" looks like
3. Build the minimal MCP generator focused on this one case
4. Test with real Stripe integration scenarios
