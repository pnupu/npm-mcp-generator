# NPM Package MCP Generator: Problem Analysis

## The Core Problem

**Developers constantly need to learn and use new NPM packages, but AI assistants don't understand package-specific APIs, patterns, and best practices.**

## Specific Use Case: Learning New NPM Packages

### Scenario

Alex is building a React app and wants to use a new NPM package like:

- `react-query` for data fetching
- `framer-motion` for animations
- `date-fns` for date manipulation
- `zod` for schema validation
- `tailwindcss` for styling

### Current Pain Points

1. **Context Switching**: Constantly switching between IDE and package docs/GitHub
2. **Generic Suggestions**: Kiro gives generic code that doesn't match the actual package API
3. **Pattern Ignorance**: AI doesn't know the package's conventions and best practices
4. **Configuration Confusion**: Struggles with setup, imports, and configuration options
5. **Example Hunting**: Spends time digging through README files and examples

### What Developers Need

- Kiro to understand the package's specific API and generate correct usage code
- Context about configuration options, common patterns, and gotchas
- Examples that match the package's actual documentation
- Knowledge of best practices and common use cases

## Why NPM Packages Are Perfect for This

### Advantages Over Stripe

1. **Broader Impact**: Every JavaScript developer uses NPM packages daily
2. **Standardized Structure**: NPM packages have consistent metadata (package.json, README, TypeScript definitions)
3. **Rich Documentation**: Most packages have README files, examples, and TypeScript definitions
4. **Measurable Success**: Easy to test if generated code actually works with the package
5. **Scalable**: Can work with thousands of packages, not just one API

### Available Data Sources

- **package.json**: Dependencies, scripts, metadata
- **README.md**: Usage examples, API documentation
- **TypeScript definitions**: Exact API structure and types
- **Examples folder**: Real usage patterns
- **GitHub repository**: Issues, discussions, additional context

## Concrete Example: `date-fns` Package

### Current Experience

Developer wants to format a date and gets generic suggestions:

```javascript
// Generic AI suggestion (often wrong)
const formatted = date.toLocaleDateString();
```

### With NPM Package MCP

Kiro would know about `date-fns` and suggest:

```javascript
// Correct date-fns usage
import { format } from "date-fns";
const formatted = format(new Date(), "yyyy-MM-dd");
```

## Success Metrics for Hackathon

### Minimum Viable Product

- **Input**: NPM package name (e.g., "date-fns")
- **Process**: Fetch package.json, README, TypeScript definitions
- **Output**: MCP server that provides package-specific context to Kiro
- **Demo**: Show Kiro generating correct usage code for 2-3 popular packages

### Validation Criteria

1. Generated code actually works with the package
2. Suggestions match the package's documented patterns
3. Includes proper imports and configuration
4. Faster than manually reading package documentation

## Technical Approach

### Data Sources to Parse

1. **NPM Registry API**: Package metadata and versions
2. **GitHub API**: README, examples, TypeScript definitions
3. **unpkg.com**: Direct access to package files
4. **TypeScript definitions**: Exact API structure

### MCP Tools to Generate

- `get_package_info`: Basic package information and description
- `get_usage_examples`: Common usage patterns and examples
- `get_api_reference`: Available functions, classes, and types
- `search_package_docs`: Search through package documentation

## Next Steps

1. Pick 2-3 popular packages to test with (date-fns, lodash, axios)
2. Analyze their documentation structure
3. Build the NPM package analyzer
4. Generate MCP servers for test packages
5. Validate with real coding scenarios
