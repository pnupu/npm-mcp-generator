# Kiro Hackathon: MCP Server Generator

## Project Overview
Building a system that can generate MCP servers from documentation and APIs to help agents generate better code.

## Initial Idea
- Website where users can link docs
- Automatically generates MCP servers that can serve agents
- Meta-concept: An MCP server that creates more MCP servers

## Problem Definition

### Core Problem
**Developers need AI code assistance that understands the specific APIs, libraries, and codebases they're working with, but creating this context is currently manual and time-consuming.**

### Specific Use Case: NPM Package Integration
Alex wants to use new NPM packages like `date-fns`, `react-query`, or `framer-motion` but constantly switches between Kiro and package docs because:
- Kiro doesn't know specific package APIs, patterns, or best practices
- Generic code suggestions don't match the actual package API
- Makes mistakes with imports, configuration, and usage patterns
- Wastes time reading through README files and examples

### The Solution
An MCP server that can analyze NPM packages (README, TypeScript definitions, examples) and provide Kiro with deep context about package-specific APIs, enabling proper package usage code generation.

## Success Metrics (Hackathon MVP)
- Generate MCP server from NPM package metadata and documentation
- Kiro produces correct usage code for popular packages (date-fns, lodash, axios)
- Generated code includes proper imports and follows package conventions
- Faster than manually reading package documentation
