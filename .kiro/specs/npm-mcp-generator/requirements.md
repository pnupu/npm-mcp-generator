# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The NPM Package MCP Generator is a system that automatically creates Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers from NPM package documentation and metadata. This addresses the critical problem where AI assistants lack knowledge of new, niche, or recently updated NPM packages, leading to generic or outdated code suggestions. The system will analyze package documentation, TypeScript definitions, and examples to generate MCP servers that provide Kiro with deep, package-specific context for better code generation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Kiro, I want AI assistance that understands new NPM packages, so that I can get accurate code suggestions without manually reading documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide an NPM package name THEN the system SHALL fetch and analyze the package's metadata, documentation, and TypeScript definitions
2. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate an MCP server that provides package-specific context to AI assistants
3. WHEN I use the generated MCP server with Kiro THEN the AI SHALL provide code suggestions that match the package's actual API and patterns
4. IF the package has TypeScript definitions THEN the system SHALL extract exact API structure and function signatures
5. IF the package has a README with code examples THEN the system SHALL parse and include usage patterns in the MCP server

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with recently updated packages, I want AI suggestions that reflect the current API version, so that I don't waste time with outdated patterns that no longer work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify a package version THEN the system SHALL analyze that specific version's documentation and API
2. WHEN a package has breaking changes between versions THEN the generated MCP server SHALL provide current API patterns
3. WHEN the AI generates code using the MCP server THEN it SHALL use the correct imports, function signatures, and patterns for the specified version
4. IF no version is specified THEN the system SHALL default to the latest stable version
5. WHEN comparing generated suggestions THEN they SHALL be demonstrably different from generic AI suggestions for packages with recent breaking changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with niche or specialized packages, I want AI assistance that understands domain-specific patterns and conventions, so that I can write correct code without deep expertise in that domain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing specialized packages (ML, 3D graphics, blockchain, etc.) THEN the system SHALL extract domain-specific patterns and conventions
2. WHEN the package has complex configuration or setup requirements THEN the MCP server SHALL provide guidance on proper initialization and configuration
3. WHEN the package has specific error handling patterns THEN the MCP server SHALL include information about proper error handling approaches
4. IF the package has examples folder or demo code THEN the system SHALL analyze and incorporate real usage patterns
5. WHEN generating code suggestions THEN they SHALL follow the package's documented best practices and conventions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server generation process to be fast and reliable, so that I can quickly get AI assistance for any NPM package I'm working with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating an MCP server THEN the process SHALL complete within 60 seconds for typical packages
2. WHEN the system encounters network errors or missing documentation THEN it SHALL provide meaningful error messages and graceful degradation
3. WHEN a package lacks certain documentation types THEN the system SHALL work with available information rather than failing completely
4. IF TypeScript definitions are unavailable THEN the system SHALL attempt to infer API structure from README examples and JSDoc comments
5. WHEN the generation process fails THEN the system SHALL log specific error details to help with debugging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated MCP server to provide comprehensive package information through well-defined tools, so that AI assistants can access the right information for different coding scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is generated THEN it SHALL provide a `get_package_info` tool that returns basic package metadata and description
2. WHEN the MCP server is generated THEN it SHALL provide a `get_usage_examples` tool that returns common usage patterns with code examples
3. WHEN the MCP server is generated THEN it SHALL provide a `get_api_reference` tool that returns available functions, classes, and interfaces
4. WHEN the MCP server is generated THEN it SHALL provide a `search_package_docs` tool that allows searching through package documentation
5. IF the package has configuration options THEN the MCP server SHALL provide a `get_configuration_guide` tool with setup instructions
6. WHEN any tool is called THEN it SHALL return structured, actionable information that AI assistants can use to generate accurate code

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that the generated MCP server actually improves AI code suggestions, so that I can trust the system is providing value.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the generated MCP server THEN there SHALL be a clear demonstration of improved code suggestions compared to generic AI responses
2. WHEN the AI generates code using the MCP server THEN the code SHALL compile and run correctly with the target package
3. WHEN comparing before/after suggestions THEN the MCP-enhanced suggestions SHALL include correct imports, proper function usage, and appropriate error handling
4. IF the package has specific patterns or conventions THEN the generated code SHALL follow those patterns
5. WHEN measuring success THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on suggestion accuracy and developer time saved
